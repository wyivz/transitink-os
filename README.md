# TransitInk OS

TransitInk OS is an ESP32-S3 firmware for a 400×300 e-paper transit dashboard,
developed for the Zectrix Note 4 hardware profile. It displays four independently
configured widgets and includes an on-device Traditional Chinese settings portal.

TransitInk OS is an independent source-available project and is not affiliated
with or endorsed by Zectrix. TransitInk OS 是獨立原始碼公開專案，與 Zectrix 沒有從屬或認可關係。
Zectrix and its product names remain the property of their respective owner.

Supported widgets:

- Bus ETA for KMB, Long Win Bus, and Citybus
- Green Minibus ETA for Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
- MTR ETA for heavy rail and Light Rail
- Transport Department journey-time indicators
- TTC surface ETA (bus/streetcar) via GTFS-Realtime Trip Updates

Original TransitInk OS source code is licensed for noncommercial purposes under
the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSE). Commercial use requires a
separate written licence from the applicable copyright holder. Redistributable
fonts, generated glyphs, vendored components, and transport data retain the
separate terms recorded in
[Third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and
[Third-party data](THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md). Binary-release recipients can also use
[Corresponding source and rebuild information](CORRESPONDING_SOURCE.md) to
reproduce the firmware with the pinned Arduino core and libraries.

## Quick start

The helper scripts are intended for macOS or Linux. Python 3 and a C/C++
toolchain are required.

```bash
scripts/install_tools.sh
scripts/audit_python_tools.sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py --check
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_transit_route_catalog.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -q
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" .venv/bin/platformio run -e zectrix_note4
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" .venv/bin/platformio check -e zectrix_note4 --fail-on-defect high
```

Before replacing the firmware, set the serial port and create a full 16 MiB
backup:

```bash
export ESP32_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
scripts/backup_flash.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
scripts/flash_firmware.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
```

If the new firmware does not work, restore the original image:

```bash
scripts/restore_flash.sh backups/<backup>.bin "$ESP32_PORT"
```

Flashing or restoring firmware can make a device temporarily unusable. Confirm
the board, flash size, and serial port before running either operation.

## First boot

When no valid settings exist, the device starts a WPA2-protected
`TransitInk-xxxx` Wi-Fi access point. Its randomly generated password is shown
on the device. Connect to it, open `http://192.168.4.1/`, enter the Wi-Fi
settings, and configure four ordered widget slots. A slot may also be disabled.
The settings access point remains available until setup is saved or the device
is restarted.

After the device has joined its configured Wi-Fi, pressing the Volume button
opens the settings portal on the device's current LAN IP instead of creating the
setup access point. The display shows the local address and a QR code containing
a random session path. The portal remains available until settings are saved,
the device is restarted, or Volume is pressed again. If normal Wi-Fi is
unavailable, the device falls back to the protected `TransitInk-xxxx` access
point.

TransitInk OS refreshes MTR every 30 seconds, bus and Green Minibus arrivals
every 60 seconds, and journey time every 120 seconds. Green Minibus setup uses
the official region, route, direction/variation, and stop identifiers. The
firmware migrates supported legacy route settings into the four-slot
configuration.

Power settings include an optional daily awake window, defaulting to 08:00–09:00
when first enabled. The device schedules one low-power timer wake at the start,
updates normally during the window, and returns to sleep at the end. Outside the
window, the Wake Up button retains its normal configurable awake duration. To
avoid extra battery use, periodic sleeping maintenance wakes are disabled while
the daily window is enabled. The schedule requires the device clock to have
been synchronized over Wi-Fi at least once since power-on.

The settings portal reads its bus, Green Minibus, MTR, and Light Rail route and
stop directories from a versioned catalog embedded in the firmware. It remains
usable without Internet access; only ETA refreshes are live. Maintainers refresh
the catalog explicitly with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_transit_route_catalog.py --refresh
```

Normal builds never contact a transport provider. A public release needs no
external catalog host: if a user cannot find a new route or stop, the
"更新及省電" page offers "找不到站牌？更新所有路線". The device refreshes the
complete KMB/Long Win, Citybus, and Green Minibus route indexes, then refreshes
the routes currently used by the four widget drafts. Other routes fetch their
stop detail once when first selected after an index update. Updated indexes and
route overrides are written atomically to LittleFS and reused on later visits. See
[Third-party data](THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md) for source attribution and
[Project structure](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for the storage boundary.

## Hardware profiles

`zectrix_note4` is the default PlatformIO environment. Its selected profile is
`include/hardware/boards/ZectrixNote4.h`, using an SSD1683-style 400×300 panel.
Product, widget, network, and portal code do not contain this board's GPIO
mapping.

See [Adding hardware](docs/ADDING_HARDWARE.md) for the supported extension path.
Do not assume the Zectrix pinout or flash layout is safe for another board.

## Web installer and releases

The browser installer is maintained in [`installer/`](installer/) so its source,
firmware version, merged image and manifest are released together. Build a local
installer package after the firmware build with:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/package_installer.py
```

Generated Pages content is written to `dist/installer/` and is not committed.
Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag whose version matches `FIRMWARE_VERSION` publishes the
merged image, checksum, legal notices and a downloadable firmware bundle as
GitHub Release assets, then deploys the same package through GitHub Pages. The
canonical installer is
[https://zerie55699.github.io/transitink-os/](https://zerie55699.github.io/transitink-os/).
