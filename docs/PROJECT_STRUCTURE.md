# Project structure

TransitInk OS keeps the standard PlatformIO source layout while separating
hardware-independent behaviour from device and network integration. This is
intentional: the pure C++ layer can be tested on a development machine without
an ESP32 toolchain or connected device.

## Production layers

### Application composition

`src/main.cpp` owns boot, Wi-Fi connection, wake/sleep behaviour, the scheduler,
display updates, configuration mode, and the top-level device lifecycle. It
constructs the concrete clients and providers but should not contain provider
parsing rules.

### Hardware profiles and adapters

`include/hardware/boards/` contains compile-time board profiles. A profile owns
display pins and controller type, battery measurement, button mapping and
polarity, and wake capabilities. `BoardSupport` exposes button and wake actions
to the application without leaking GPIO numbers into `main.cpp`.

`SelectedDisplayDriver` maps a profile's controller type to a driver under
`src/hardware/displays/`. `EInkDisplay` owns only the product renderer and frame
refresh policy. A board using the same controller only needs a new profile;
another controller also needs a driver implementing the selected driver's
`begin`, `show`, and `showPartialRegion` surface.

The current dashboard renderer requires an exact 400×300 canvas. Supporting a
different screen size requires a renderer/layout addition,
not board-specific conditionals in the existing renderer.

### Device and service integration

The top level of `src/` contains the Arduino-facing implementation:

- `EInkDisplay` and `HkGlyphFont` render the 400×300 user interface.
- `BatteryMonitor` consumes the selected board's battery profile.
- `ConfigStore`, `AppConfig`, `ConfigPortal`, `PortalConfigCodec`, and
  `TransitInkPortalPage` own persistent settings and the local web portal.
- `KmbClient`, `CitybusClient`, `GmbClient`, `MtrClient`, `LightRailClient`,
  `JourneyTimeClient`, `TtcClient`, and `WeatherClient` perform remote data access.
- `ConfigPortal` streams versioned gzip bus, Green Minibus, MTR, Light Rail,
  and TTC assets directly from generated PROGMEM arrays without decompressing them in
  ESP32 RAM. `WidgetCatalogService` owns compact journey-time projections and
  the refreshed route index and per-route LittleFS stop overrides.

### Frontend transport catalog

`scripts/generate_transit_route_catalog.py` is the maintainer path for bulk
low-frequency official route and stop sources. It validates and deterministically
generates `index.json.gz`, three provider stop packs, `rail.json.gz`, a manifest,
and the C++ PROGMEM arrays under `src/generated/`. A normal firmware build reads
the tracked output and performs no catalog downloads.

The portal loads the embedded index and rail assets alongside `/api/config`,
loads a provider stop pack only when it is needed, then resolves route,
direction and stop selections in the browser. Normal selection never calls an
official route API. Journey-time locations remain small API projections, and
live ETA clients are independent from this catalog path.

When a route or stop is absent, the user chooses "找不到站牌？更新所有路線" under
"更新及省電". The device refreshes the complete KMB/Long Win, Citybus, and Green
Minibus route indexes. Routes already used by the four widget drafts refresh
their directions and stops in the same operation; another route refreshes and
persists its detail the first time it is selected after the index update.
`WidgetCatalogService` validates the responses and atomically replaces both the
updated route index and route-specific LittleFS JSON overrides using temporary
and backup files. The portal overlays those files on the firmware baseline on
later visits. No catalog base URL, signing key, release server, or whole-catalog
first-run download is required.

### Domain core

`include/core/` and `src/core/` contain bounded parsing and business rules that
do not depend on display or Wi-Fi hardware. This includes widget configuration,
normalised snapshots, scheduling, portal request authentication, battery
status, and journey-time XML parsing.

New rules should go here when they can be expressed without Arduino APIs. This
keeps them fast to compile and easy to exercise with strict host warnings.

### Provider adapters

`src/providers/` converts bus, Green Minibus, rail, and journey-time responses into common widget
snapshots. `WidgetProviderRouter` is the dispatch boundary used by
`WidgetScheduler`; display code should consume snapshots instead of calling an
operator client directly.

## Test layers

The three test directories have distinct roles and should not be merged merely
for naming consistency:

- `test_host/` compiles pure C and C++ modules with the system compiler using
  `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. It also owns bounded external-response fixtures.
- `test_native/` uses PlatformIO's native Unity runner for production code that
  needs small Arduino or Preferences compatibility shims.
- `tests/` contains Python tests that assert source boundaries, portal
  behaviour, and the firmware's structural contracts. `tests/test_core.py`
  also orchestrates the native C/C++ executables.

The single local verification entry point is:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -q
```

The detailed board extension procedure is documented in
[Adding hardware](ADDING_HARDWARE.md).

## Generated and local-only content

These paths are deliberately excluded from Git:

- `.venv/`, `.platformio/`, and `.pio/` — local tools, packages, and builds
- `.catalog-cache/` — resumable official-source downloads used by the generator
- `.test-build/` — native test executables and objects
- `backups/` — full device flash images, which may contain credentials
- `dist/` — generated release assets and deployable installer package
- `.superpowers/` — local agent workspace

Tracked generated glyph and catalog C++ sources are required by the firmware
build. Their generators, deterministic inputs, gzip assets, manifests and
licensing boundaries live under `scripts/`, `data/catalog/`,
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and `THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md`.

## Release and installer boundary

`installer/` contains only reviewed static source. `scripts/package_installer.py`
reads the single firmware version from `include/ProductConfig.h`, merges the
Zectrix Note 4 bootloader, partition table, Arduino boot application and
firmware at their verified offsets, then creates a relative ESP Web Tools
manifest, SHA-256 checksum and release metadata under `dist/installer/`.

The release workflow rejects a tag that does not match `FIRMWARE_VERSION`. The
same generated binary is uploaded to the GitHub Release and deployed through
GitHub Pages, so the installer cannot silently point at a different firmware
than the release asset.
