# Development

This guide is for the **TTC edition** of TransitInk OS (see the root
[README](../README.md)). The build/test/flash workflow matches the upstream
project; the live transit path and catalog tooling are TTC-specific.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux with Bash
- Python 3
- a C and C++ compiler with C++17 support
- USB access to an ESP32-S3 device for backup, flash, or serial verification

The checked-in helper creates a repository-local virtual environment and
installs the pinned PlatformIO and esptool versions:

```bash
scripts/install_tools.sh
scripts/audit_python_tools.sh
```

PlatformIO packages are kept under `.platformio/` so builds do not depend on a
developer's global PlatformIO state. The firmware platform is pinned to
pioarduino 55.03.39 (Arduino ESP32 3.3.9 / ESP-IDF 5.5.4), while all directly
declared libraries use exact versions.

## Test

Run all structure tests, host C++ tests, and native PlatformIO Unity tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -q
```

The suite expects `.venv/bin/platformio` to exist, so run the setup script once
before the first test.

Run the same high-severity C/C++ static-analysis gate used by CI and releases:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" \
  .venv/bin/platformio check -e zectrix_note4 --fail-on-defect high
```

## Build

```bash
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" .venv/bin/platformio run -e zectrix_note4
```

Each supported board has its own PlatformIO environment and compile-time board
profile. See [Adding hardware](ADDING_HARDWARE.md) before introducing a new one.

The main build outputs are written below `.pio/build/zectrix_note4/` and are not
committed.

## Back up, flash, and restore

Always back up a device before its first TransitInk flash. The backup is a full
16 MiB image and may contain Wi-Fi credentials or other device state, so it must
remain under the ignored `backups/` directory. The helper creates backup files
with owner-only permissions; preserve those permissions when copying a backup.

```bash
export ESP32_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
scripts/backup_flash.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
scripts/flash_firmware.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
```

Restore only a verified 16 MiB image created from the same hardware profile:

```bash
scripts/restore_flash.sh backups/<backup>.bin "$ESP32_PORT"
```

The scripts also accept `ESP32_PORT`, `ESP32_BAUD`, `ESP32_CHIP`,
`ESP32_FLASH_SIZE`, `TRANSITINK_BOARD`, and `PLATFORMIO_ENV` environment
variables. A serial port must be passed explicitly or supplied through
`ESP32_PORT`; the remaining defaults preserve the Zectrix Note 4 workflow.

## Regenerate the bitmap glyph table

The TTC English edition keeps a slim Latin-focused seed. The glyph pipeline still uses the historical `generate_hk_glyph_font.py` name and
vendored Noto Sans CJK HK font files. In this TTC edition the product UI is
English, but the same generator remains the supported way to rebuild the
embedded bitmap table used by the e-ink renderer.

`scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py` scans production source plus the deterministic
seed in `scripts/hk_glyph_seed.txt`. It rasterises the pinned Noto Sans CJK HK
Regular 2.004 font with the pinned Pillow version from `requirements-dev.txt`.
The generator verifies the vendored OTF SHA-256 before producing output, so it
does not depend on an installed system font, CoreText, or macOS `sips`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py --check
```

Do not hand-edit `src/generated/HkGlyphFontData.cpp`. The stable declarations in
`include/HkGlyphFont.h` and lookup code in `src/HkGlyphFont.cpp` remain normal
project source. The generated bitmap data and source font are distributed under
OFL-1.1; their exact provenance and licence are retained under
`third_party/fonts/noto-sans-cjk-hk/`.

For local experiments only, a different font may be selected explicitly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py \
  --font /path/to/font-file --allow-unverified-font
```

Do not commit experimental output. Release builds and CI must use the vendored
font and pass the default `--check` command.

## Change boundaries

- Put hardware-independent validation, parsing, and scheduling in `src/core/`.
- Put GPIO maps and electrical capabilities in a board profile; put controller
  commands in a hardware driver.
- Keep `main.cpp` free of direct `pinMode`, `digitalRead`, and GPIO wake calls.
- Keep operator-specific network handling in clients and normalisation in
  `src/providers/`.
- Keep display code dependent on normalised snapshots, not raw remote payloads.
- Never commit Wi-Fi credentials, flash backups, serial logs with secrets, or
  local portal tokens.
- Add or update a host/native test for behavioural changes and a structure test
  when preserving an architectural boundary matters.

## Installer and release package

After a successful firmware build, generate the exact package used by GitHub
Pages and GitHub Releases:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/package_installer.py
```

The output under `dist/installer/` includes the versioned merged image,
`manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and machine-readable release metadata. It is
ignored because releases are reproducibly generated from source. Do not copy
the nested `.git` directory from the ignored legacy installer clone.

Before publishing, update `FIRMWARE_VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md`, review the
third-party notices and catalog attribution, run the checks above from a clean
checkout, scan both the working tree and Git history for secrets, and verify the
candidate on its supported hardware. Commit the reviewed tree and push a
matching `vX.Y.Z` tag. The release workflow tests and builds from the tag before
publishing any asset or deploying GitHub Pages.
